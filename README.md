# Eyes-Exercise
## This exercise will use the styled properties to track the curser movement with the "Eyes"

**To Run, simply follow the link and move your cursor around the page and watch as the eyes track your cursor movement.

Future updates to this code will include adding a relative gradient feature that will change the color of the eyes dynamically as your cursor moves to different areas of the page.
